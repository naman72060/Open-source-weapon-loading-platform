# Open Source Weapon Loading Platform

    Purpose
    - This repository contains the core source assets for a modular loading-platform research prototype.

    Folders kept in this repository
    - `CAD and meachanical design/` — Native CAD source (SolidWorks parts and assemblies), STEP/IGES exports, and 3D models.
    - `Electronics and PCB/` — PCB schematics, board sources, BOMs, and Gerber output (fabrication artifacts).
    - `Firmware and Code/` — Embedded firmware source and component-specific code.

    What I removed from this README
    - Non-essential helper folders (for example `scripts/`) and extended documentation sections have been removed to keep this README focused on the three core areas listed above.

    Quick notes
    - Large binary files (CAD, images) are intentionally stored in their respective folders; avoid committing frequent binary diffs when possible.
    - For build or flashing instructions, check `Firmware and Code/README.md` (if present) inside that folder.

    License
    - See `LICENSE` at the repository root for full terms (MIT License).

    If you want, I can also remove the `scripts/` folder and any helper files I previously added. Reply "remove scripts" to confirm and I will delete them next.
